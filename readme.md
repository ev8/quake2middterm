This mod turns quake 2's deathmatch into a survival/ invasion game mode

bind functions wavestart and upgrade 

wave start begins the game, in twenty seconds enemeies will start spawning, the wave ends when all monsters have been defeated
players will then be given a 20 second grace period to gather supplies ,ammo and  health before the next awave begins.

killing monsters grants the player experience points, get enough and you level up. 
leveling up gives you ability points which you can use to buy upgrades to your basic abilities
pressing the upgrade key will bring up a menu with avialable upgrades and cost
the top line represents
wave number ,monsters left ,player level ,ability points
use [ and ] to navigate the menu and enter to select an item, esc closes the menu

unfortunately this mod is hard coded for the map edge, 

credit for the menu code goes to online gaming technologies and the qdevels get credit for thier utility functions

i've also added a config file and a clean built gamex86.dll to the repo incase there are any issues
the config file binds wave start to j and upgrade to l
